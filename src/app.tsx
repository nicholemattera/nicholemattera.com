            <p className={cn('mt-4 text-muted-foreground md:text-lg')}>
              I've been interested in and passionate about programming since I was a kid. I started tinkering on an old
              486 laptop with Borland C++ modifying examples to make fake installation applications. Once I got my Sony
              PSP in high school, I created and released homebrew applications. With that experience, I got a job out of
              high school with PosiMotion.
            </p>
            <p className={cn('mt-4 text-muted-foreground md:text-lg')}>
              Today, I still have a passion for programming with plenty of side projects outside of work. I have also
              picked up a few more hobbies, such as rock climbing, hiking, and photography. In my free time, I also
              volunteer with Open Arms of Minnesota, helping to provide nourishing meals to critically ill individuals
              and their families.
